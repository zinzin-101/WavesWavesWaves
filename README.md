## Features <br />
-Wave simulation using modified sum of sines approximation and domain warping <br />
-Free camera <br />
-Controllable boat <br />
-Other boat AIs <br />
## Controls <br />
WASD -> move boat towards look direction (in boat camera mode) <br />
WASD -> move free camera (in free camera mode) <br />
(Hold) LShift -> Increase free camera speed movement <br />
V -> switch camera <br />
